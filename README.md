# Naira Recognition App

## Insipration
An estimated 4.25 million adults aged 40 years in Nigeria are visually impaired or blind. [Reference](https://iceh.lshtm.ac.uk/nigeria-national-blindness-and-visual-impairment-survey/) and this number is expected to rise by average every year.</br>
The naira does not have any marking for thise visually inpaired to know which one they are holding.</br>  
This people interact with the community every day. Imagine taking a ride on on getting there he is required to pay, the man will depend on the honesty of the driver to know the amount he/she is holding.</br></br>
The android application is to help them know to the amount in thier hands before giving the driver.</br>

## How to solve this</br>
We would solve this problem with Machine learning by training a neural network using <b>keras</b> with tensorflow backend.</br>
With images of the naira note from #5 denomination to #1000. At different position to train the model for better accuracy.</br>

This will improve their lifes becuase they wiil no longer depend on the honesty of the drivers to know the naira note in their hands

## Implementation
The building process will be in two phase
- <b>Prove of concept</b></br>
During this time, we would train with two naira note to understand.</br>
Do some tweaking, hyperparameter tuning of the model. Just to know what works best.</br></br>
- <b>Full model build</b></br>
This phase will involve training the model on the eight (8) naira notes, beta testing and tuning the model for better accuracy, precision,and sensitivity.</br>
Building the android version

## Technology stacks
- Keras with Tensorflow backend
- Android studio 3.0+
- Android 5.0+ upwards
